  ABSTRACT =     {Time-scale modification (TSM) is the task of
                  speeding up or slowing down an audio signal’s
                  playback speed without changing its pitch. In
                  digital music production, TSM has become an
                  indispensable tool, which is nowadays integrated in
                  a wide range of music production software. Music
                  signals are diverse—they comprise harmonic,
                  percussive, and transient components, among
                  others. Because of this wide range of acoustic and
                  musical characteristics, there is no single TSM
                  method that can cope with all kinds of audio signals
                  equally well. Our main objective is to foster a
                  better understanding of the capabilities and
                  limitations of TSM procedures. To this end, we
                  review fundamental TSM methods, discuss typical
                  challenges, and indicate potential solutions that
                  combine different strategies. In particular, we
                  discuss a fusion approach that involves recent
                  techniques for harmonic-percussive separation along
                  with time-domain and frequency-domain TSM
                  procedures.},
